Example description
===================
This example describes how to use GPIO BSRR (Port bit set/reset register) and 
BRR (Port bit reset register) for IO toggling.
These registers allow modifying only one or several GPIO pins in a single atomic
write access.


Directory contents
==================
stm32f10x_conf.h  Library Configuration file
stm32f10x_it.c    Interrupt handlers
stm32f10x_it.h    Header for stm32f10x_it.c
main.c            Main program


Hardware environment
====================
 - Connect four leds to pins PC.06, PC.07, PC.08 and PC.09(respectively LD1, LD2, LD3  
   and LD4 on STM3210B-EVAL board). 

      
How to use it
=============
In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
- Create a project and setup all your toolchain's start-up files
- Compile the directory content files and required Library files:
  + stm32f10x_lib.c
  + stm32f10x_gpio.c
  + stm32f10x_rcc.c
  + stm32f10x_nvic.c
  + stm32f10x_flash.c
    
- Link all compiled files and load your image into either RAM or Flash
- Run the example
